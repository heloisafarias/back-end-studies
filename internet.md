The Internet is a network of networks. But what is a network?
Network is a group of devices grouped together. The connection between them is called Internet.

The way the Internet connects the devices is through protocols. These protocols define how data is exchanged between devices in a secure and reliable way.

The core of the Internet is a network of routers interconnected, that are responsible for the traffic between differents devices and systems.

In this image we can see how data is send to another device. But how are these packets being sent correctly?

Do you remember protocols? They are responsible for sending the data to the correct destination/device. Some protocols that are well known for this process are IP/TCP.

* IP - Internet Protocol is responsible for routing the packets for the correct destination.


* TCP - Transmission Control Protocol is responsible for assuring those packets are trustable and are in the correct order.
